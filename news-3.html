			<h2>Game of Thrones star Kit Harington reveals why Jon Snow wouldn’t have made a good king</h2>
			<p class="description">Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington has revealed why Jon Snow wouldn’t have made a good king if he won the Iron Throne at the end of the series.</p>
			<p>The HBO fantasy show ended its final season with Bran Stark (Isaac Hempstead Wright) unexpectedly becoming king of the seven kingdoms. This decision sparked a backlash from fans who were hoping to see Snow and Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) take joint power.</p>
			<p>In a recent video chat with Twitter user @purple_dwagon, Harington argued that it was for Jon to end up in the North as opposed to on the Iron Throne.</p>
			<p>“When people say ‘I wish you had been on the Throne’, or ‘I wish you had been with Dany on the Throne,’ I would disagree because Jon’s place was always in the north,” he said.</p>
			<p>“He would never have been happy in the south. He’s like Ned Stark. When Ned goes south, he’s in danger. Jon is always happiest… it’s like when Tormund says to him, ‘you’re of the north.’ It’s right. He belongs north of the wall.”</p>
			<p>Revealing that he hasn’t actually seen the finale, Harington added: “He’s been saddled with this weight all through the series, and he’s this heavy character – he’s literally got the cloak on and he’s heavy.</p>
			<p>"And what I wanted with that last bit is there to be this lightness about him. It’s all falling off, this terrible thing that he’s been through is all falling off as he goes north of the wall.”</p>
