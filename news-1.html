                <h2>Game of Thrones prequel is confirmed</h2>
                <p class="description">A new teaser for HBO Max confirms that House of the Dragon, the prequel to HBO’s epic fantasy series Game of Thrones, will premiere in 2022.</p>
                <p>HBO recently announced that Olivia Cooke (Ready Player One), Emma D’Arcy (Truth Seekers), and Matt Smith (Doctor Who) have joined the cast. Cooke will play Alicent Hightower, a close confidant of King Viserys Targaryen (Paddy Considine), while D’Arcy also takes a lead role as as Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, and Smith appears as her uncle Prince Daemon Targaryen.</p>
                <p>Set 300 years before the events of Game of Thrones, the series tells the story of a turbulent period for House Targaryen, one that set sibling against sibling and dragon against dragon. The point of contention: who should rule on the Iron Throne, of course.</p>
                <p>Casting reportedly began in July 2020, and HBO described Considine, Cooke, D’Arcy, and Smith’s roles as follows:</p>
                <p>Paddy Considine as King Viserys Targaryen. Viserys was chosen by the lords of Westeros to succeed the Old King, Jaehaerys Targaryen, at the Great Council at Harrenhal.</p>
                <p>Olivia Cooke as Alicent Hightower. She’s the daughter of Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King, and the most comely woman in the Seven Kingdoms.</p>
                <p>Emma D’Arcy as Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen. The king’s first-born child. She is of pure Valyrian blood, and she is a dragonrider.</p>
                <p>Matt Smith as Prince Daemon Targaryen. The younger brother of King Viserys and heir to the throne, Daemon is a peerless warrior and a dragonrider who possesses the true blood of the dragon.</p>
