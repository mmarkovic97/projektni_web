			<h2>Game of Thrones producers begged HBO bosses to film iconic battle scene: ‘We went down on bended knee’</h2>
			<p class="description">Ambitious battle sequence had to be pared back despite an additional $2m granted for the episode.</p>
			<p>The Game of Thrones producers have revealed they had to plead with the bosses at HBO to let them film the Battle of Blackwater.</p>
			<p>The legendary season two battle, which sees Stannis Baratheon attempt to take King’s Landing and seize the Iron Throne from Joffrey, almost didn’t get made.</p>
			<p>In an extract of James Hibberd’s forthcoming book Fire Cannot Kill a Dragon, released by Vanity Fair, the series’ showrunners David Benioff and Dan Weiss admitted to the difficulties they faced when trying to get the iconic scene filmed.</p>
			<p>“There was talk of turning Blackwater into a land battle, which would have been terrible. We begged and pleaded with Mike Lombardo [former HBO boss],” said Weiss. “We had a big conversation about how many boats we could do.”</p>
			<p>Benioff added: “We went down on bended knee: ‘Just this once, please.’”</p>
			<p>The pair were granted an extra $2m (£1.5m) to bring the Battle of Blackwater to life, as well as an extra week of filming.</p>
			<p>However, the original scene written in the books was still too ambitious to stage so its author George RR Martin was tasked with downsizing his vision.</p>
			<p>Martin told Hibberd: “We had to scale down Blackwater considerably from the book. They told me right from the start that the bridge of boats would be impossible.”</p>
